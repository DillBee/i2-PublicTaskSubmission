# i2-PublicTaskSubmission
Dylan Berwick's task submission for the A multiplied to equal X code.

The code was written with PHP 8.1.5. Was also written under the assumption of using full integers instead of floating point.

I am certain the code meets all the requirements of the brief and I look forward to hearing back from you ðŸ™‚.
